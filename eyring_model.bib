	abstract = {We performed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and solvent permeation experiments to unravel the mechanism of water transport in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The NEMD simulations reveal that water transport is driven by a pressure gradient within the membranes, not by a water concentration gradient, in marked contrast to the classic solution-diffusion model. We further show that water molecules travel as clusters through a network of pores that are transiently connected. Permeation experiments with water and organic solvents using polyamide and cellulose triacetate RO membranes showed that solvent permeance depends on the membrane pore size, kinetic diameter of solvent molecules, and solvent viscosity. This observation is not consistent with the solution-diffusion model, where permeance depends on the solvent solubility. Motivated by these observations, we demonstrate that the solution-friction model, in which transport is driven by a pressure gradient, can describe water and solvent transport in RO membranes.

              The preferential removal of sodium sulfate over sodium chloride (fractionation) by nanofiltration (NF) is studied. A fractionation metric,
              M
              , is defined, and a simple set of equations are derived to describe its variation due to operating parameters, such as temperature and pressure. The use of these equations to explain known behavior of NF systems and suggest improvements in system or membrane design is demonstrated. Furthermore, the derived framework is applicable to all membranes used in pressure-driven technologies, without detailed characterization of specific membrane properties, such as structural parameters (pore radius, active layer thickness, tortuosity, porosity) or charge-based parameters. Given that the principal applications of NF involve the selective removal of multivalent ions over monovalent ions, the introduced metric provides a direct measure of its efficacy in such applications, and is shown to be more accurate in some cases than comparing salt rejection ratios, as usually done. Finally, the concept of ‘breakthrough’, commonly observed as the point at which rejection ratio begins to decrease with increase in pressure, is mathematically described, and its implication on selectivity discussed.},

            Synthetic polymer membranes are enabling components in key technologies at the water–energy nexus, including desalination and energy conversion, because of their high water/salt selectivity or ionic conductivity. However, many applications at the water–energy nexus require ion selectivity, or separation of specific ionic species from other similar species. Here, the ion selectivity of conventional polymeric membrane materials is assessed and recent progress in enhancing selective transport via tailored free volume elements and ion–membrane interactions is described. In view of the limitations of polymeric membranes, three material classes—porous crystalline materials, 2D materials, and discrete biomimetic channels—are highlighted as possible candidates for ion‐selective membranes owing to their molecular‐level control over physical and chemical properties. Lastly, research directions and critical challenges for developing bioinspired membranes with molecular recognition are provided.},

In contrast, weaker binding species are precluded from diffusing into the polymer membrane, which leads to passage proportional to binding energy and independent of membrane thickness. Our findings demonstrate that selectivity of polymeric membranes can markedly increase by tailoring ion-membrane binding energy and minimizing membrane thickness.

          , 
            State-of-the-art desalination membranes exhibit high water-salt selectivity, but their ability to discriminate between ions is limited. Elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying ion transport and selectivity in subnanometer pores is therefore imperative for the development of ion-selective membranes. Here, we compare the overall energy barrier for salt transport and energy barriers for individual ion transport, showing that cations and anions traverse the membrane pore in an independent manner. Supported by density functional theory simulations, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between permeating counterion and fixed charges on the membrane substantially hinder intrapore diffusion. Furthermore, using quartz crystal microbalance, we break down the contributions of partitioning at the pore mouth and intrapore diffusion to the overall energy barrier for salt transport. Overall, our results indicate that intrapore diffusion governs salt transport through subnanometer pores due to ion-pore wall interactions, providing the scientific base for the design of membranes with high ion-ion selectivity.},
