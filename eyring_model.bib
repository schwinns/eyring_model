The NEMD simulations reveal that water transport is driven by a pressure gradient within the membranes, not by a water concentration gradient, in marked contrast to the classic solution-diffusion model. We further show that water molecules travel as clusters through a network of pores that are transiently connected. Permeation experiments with water and organic solvents using polyamide and cellulose triacetate RO membranes showed that solvent permeance depends on the membrane pore size, kinetic diameter of solvent molecules, and solvent viscosity. This observation is not consistent with the solution-diffusion model, where permeance depends on the solvent solubility. Motivated by these observations, we demonstrate that the solution-friction model, in which transport is driven by a pressure gradient, can describe water and solvent transport in RO membranes.

          , 
            State-of-the-art desalination membranes exhibit high water-salt selectivity, but their ability to discriminate between ions is limited. Elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying ion transport and selectivity in subnanometer pores is therefore imperative for the development of ion-selective membranes. Here, we compare the overall energy barrier for salt transport and energy barriers for individual ion transport, showing that cations and anions traverse the membrane pore in an independent manner. Supported by density functional theory simulations, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between permeating counterion and fixed charges on the membrane substantially hinder intrapore diffusion. Furthermore, using quartz crystal microbalance, we break down the contributions of partitioning at the pore mouth and intrapore diffusion to the overall energy barrier for salt transport. Overall, our results indicate that intrapore diffusion governs salt transport through subnanometer pores due to ion-pore wall interactions, providing the scientific base for the design of membranes with high ion-ion selectivity.},

Our findings demonstrate that selectivity of polymeric membranes can markedly increase by tailoring ion-membrane binding energy and minimizing membrane thickness.

            Synthetic polymer membranes are enabling components in key technologies at the water–energy nexus, including desalination and energy conversion, because of their high water/salt selectivity or ionic conductivity. However, many applications at the water–energy nexus require ion selectivity, or separation of specific ionic species from other similar species. Here, the ion selectivity of conventional polymeric membrane materials is assessed and recent progress in enhancing selective transport via tailored free volume elements and ion–membrane interactions is described. In view of the limitations of polymeric membranes, three material classes—porous crystalline materials, 2D materials, and discrete biomimetic channels—are highlighted as possible candidates for ion‐selective membranes owing to their molecular‐level control over physical and chemical properties. Lastly, research directions and critical challenges for developing bioinspired membranes with molecular recognition are provided.},

              The preferential removal of sodium sulfate over sodium chloride (fractionation) by nanofiltration (NF) is studied. A fractionation metric,
              M
              , is defined, and a simple set of equations are derived to describe its variation due to operating parameters, such as temperature and pressure. The use of these equations to explain known behavior of NF systems and suggest improvements in system or membrane design is demonstrated. Furthermore, the derived framework is applicable to all membranes used in pressure-driven technologies, without detailed characterization of specific membrane properties, such as structural parameters (pore radius, active layer thickness, tortuosity, porosity) or charge-based parameters. Given that the principal applications of NF involve the selective removal of multivalent ions over monovalent ions, the introduced metric provides a direct measure of its efficacy in such applications, and is shown to be more accurate in some cases than comparing salt rejection ratios, as usually done. Finally, the concept of ‘breakthrough’, commonly observed as the point at which rejection ratio begins to decrease with increase in pressure, is mathematically described, and its implication on selectivity discussed.},

              Polyamide membranes have been used in large-scale desalination for decades. However, because of the thinness of the membranes and their internal variability, it has been hard to determine which aspects of the membranes most affect their performance. Culp
              et al.
              combined electron tomography, nanoscale three-dimensional (3D) polyamide density mapping, and modeling of bulk water permeability with zero adjustable parameters to quantify the effect of 3D nanoscale variations in polymer mass on water transport within the polyamide membrane (see the Perspective by Geise). They found that variability in local density most affects the performance of the membranes. Better synthesis methods could thus improve performance without affecting selectivity.

          , 
            Biological membranes can achieve remarkably high permeabilities, while maintaining ideal selectivities, by relying on well-defined internal nanoscale structures in the form of membrane proteins. Here, we apply such design strategies to desalination membranes. A series of polyamide desalination membranes—which were synthesized in an industrial-scale manufacturing line and varied in processing conditions but retained similar chemical compositions—show increasing water permeability and active layer thickness with constant sodium chloride selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy measurements enabled us to determine nanoscale three-dimensional polyamide density maps and predict water permeability with zero adjustable parameters. Density fluctuations are detrimental to water transport, which makes systematic control over nanoscale polyamide inhomogeneity a key route to maximizing water permeability without sacrificing salt selectivity in desalination membranes.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effect of the variance of pore size distribution on the transport properties of rocks. Several heterogeneous network realizations with very broad, uniform, or log uniform pore size distributions were constructed. A series of networks were then derived deterministically from these initial networks by repeatedly applying a shrinking operator to the pores of the original realizations. This operator was devised in such a way as to maintain the mean pore size constant while changing the variance of the pore size distribution, therefore allowing its effect on the transport properties to be isolated. We thus assessed the validity of several permeability models from the literature as a function of the variance of the pore size distribution. We found that the product of the permeability by the electrical formation factor was proportional to the square of the critical radius as proposed in the Katz‐Thompson model [
              Katz and Thompson
              , 1986]. However, we observed that the dramatic flow localization occurring at high pore size variance was not restricted to the backbone of the critical subnetwork (or critical path) as assumed in the Katz‐Thompson model. We propose that a better justification of the relation mentioned above arises from the underlying percolation problem of the viscous‐inertial transition observed in harmonic flow as a function of frequency. In addition, we appraised the stochastic Bernabé‐Revil model [
              Bernabé and Revil
              , 1995]. We found that this model was more and more difficult to implement as the pore size variance was increased. A possible interpretation could be that at high levels of pore‐scale heterogeneity, very large pore size fluctuations occur and the flow pattern is so strongly and determimstically related to these extreme fluctuations that a stochastic description becomes inadequate.},

              We investigate the behavior of two-dimensional resistor networks, with finite sizes and different kinds (rectangular, hexagonal, and triangular) of lattice geometry. We construct a network by having a network unit repeat itself

              We consider a multipurpose
              n
              ‐step network with cross resistors that is a profound problem that has not been resolved before. This network contains a number of different types of resistor network model. This problem is resolved by three steps: First of all, we simplify a complex graphics into a simple equivalent model; next, we use Kirchhoff's laws to analyse the network and establish a nonlinear difference equation; and finally, we construct the method of equivalent transformation to obtain the general solution of the nonlinear difference equation. In this paper, we created a new concept of negative resistance for the needs of the equivalent conversion and obtain two general resistance formulae of a multipurpose ladder network of cross resistors. As applications, several interesting specific results are produced. In particular, an

            Water scarcity is one of the greatest societal challenges facing humanity. Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, a widely used membrane-based technology, has proven to be effective to augment water supply in water-stressed regions of our planet. However, progress in the design and development of RO membranes has been limited. To significantly enhance the performance of RO membranes, it is essential to acquire a deep understanding of the membrane separation and transport mechanisms. In this tutorial review, we cover the pivotal historical developments in RO technology, examine the chemical and physical properties of RO membrane materials, and critically review the models and mechanisms proposed for water transport in RO membranes. Based on recent experimental and computational findings, we conduct a thorough analysis of the key transport models—the solution–diffusion and pore-flow models—to assess their validity for accurately describing water transport in RO membranes. Our analysis involves examining the experimental evidence in favor of the solution–diffusion mechanism. Specifically, we explain whether the water content gradient within the membrane, cited as evidence for the key assumption in the solution–diffusion model, can drive a diffusive transport through RO membranes. Additionally, we review the recent molecular dynamics simulations which support the pore-flow mechanism for describing water transport in RO membranes. We conclude by providing future research directions aimed at addressing key knowledge gaps in water transport phenomena in RO membranes, with the goal of advancing the development of next-generation RO membranes.},
